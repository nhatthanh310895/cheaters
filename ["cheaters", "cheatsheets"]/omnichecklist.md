---
### Daily

* Go through your morning ritual (See [section 5 on rituals][6]).
* Look at your forecast view to see how busy you will be today and tomorrow (see [post 3.5 on perspectives][7] and [post 3.7 on workflow][8]).
* Go to your planning perspective to pick 6 tasks to work on (see [post 3.5 on perspectives][7]).
* Go to your execution perspective to focus on those 6 tasks (see [post 3.5 on perspectives][7]).
* Follow this simple Asian Efficiency system every day to focus and getting your most important tasks done (see [post 3.7 for the AE system][8]).
* Clear your OmniFocus inbox at the end of each day (see [post 3.8 on inbox processing][9]).

### Weekly

* Every Friday or Sunday, do your weekly review to maintain your setup (see [post 3.6 on reviewing][10]).
* Maintain your weekly rituals and routines (see [section 5 on rituals][6]).

### Monthly

* Maintain your monthly rituals and routines (see [section 5 on rituals][6]),
* Can you turn recurring tasks into OmniFocus repeating tasks? (See [post 4.2 on repeating tasks][11]).

### Quarterly

* Evaluate your projects, lists, contexts and perspectives. Which can be deleted? Which need to be altered? (See [post 3.6 on reviewing][10]).
* Evaluate your system. Is it still working for you? Where do you need to make tweaks? (See [section 4 on power user tips][12]).

### Common Pitfalls (And What To Do About Them)

* You feel like your current OmniFocus system is not working anymore. Start from scratch again and read [section 3 on getting started][13].
* Your OmniFocus inbox is overflowing. Start clearing it out twice a day—once mid-day and once before the end of the day (See [post 3.8 on inbox processing][9]).
* The contexts you’re using are confusing or don’t make sense anymore. Re-do them by following our suggestions in [post 3.4 on contexts][14].
* You miss your weekly reviews. Schedule a fixed time and day for it. See [post 3.6 on reviewing][10].
* You’re not sure when you use a folder or how to categorize your areas of responsibilities. [Read post 3.3 to find out how we set it up][15].
