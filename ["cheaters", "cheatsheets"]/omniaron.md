## 1\. Introduction

_OmniFocus Premium Posts_.

One major shift that occurred in my setup over the past 12 months has been a move towards utilizing OmniFocus 2 for only my personal projects.

Why?

Because as new team members joined Asian Efficiency, we found that it was hard for everyone to have separate OmniFocus setups, with no shared collaboration space. So instead, we adopted first Asana and then JIRA to handle our team collaboration needs (see more in the [OmniFocus for Teams post][1]).

My setup now looks something like this:

![jira of evernote][2]

I essentially treat OmniFocus 2
:as my single source of truth for personal actions and projects, and JIRA as my source for business-related items. Both are then managed through my Agile Results-style journal system within Evernote.

One notable difference with my setup is that
:I don't use reviews in OmniFocus—I find that _Agile Results_-style areas or hotspots tend to create living lists rather than projects that stagnate, and so they are always "under review" so to speak.

* * *

## 2\. Folder and Project Structure

![aaronlynn folder projects][3]

**Inbox**

The inbox is where I quick-capture almost everything.

I'm not a fan of not being able to see how many actions are in my inbox without selecting it (like you could in OmniFocus 1), but it still works as an inbox should.

I also don't quick-capture that much on the desktop—most of my quick-capture takes place on my phone, usually when I'm out doing something.

### Areas and Projects

**Renovations &amp; Mental Models**

These are the two personal projects that I have going at the moment.

While two may seem like a relatively small number, it is the result of a process of refinement of reducing personal commitments so that I can focus better in on what really matters to me—building Asian Efficiency, and helping the team achieve their vision.

I like to think of it this way: if productivity is the amount of time that you can dedicate towards achieving your goals—why not try to dedicate as close to 100% of your time as you can? Any time/energy spent elsewhere simply detracts from that.

The other reason that I have relatively few personal projects is because of my areas/hotspots-style setup from _Agile Results—_a lot of things that others may put into projects are instead found in those single-action lists.

**Aside**: _Renovations are some repairs I'm having done at my apartment. Mental models is an ongoing project where I learn about a different decision-making or analysis model weekly and implement it in different parts of my life._

**Personal Systems**

The personal systems list stores any tasks or actions related to refining or modifying the various systems I have in my personal life. This can be anything from how I read books, to my core values, to say, for example, streamlining my 1Password database.

**Health**

Anything and everything related to physical health. Think: medical stuff and working out.

**Relationships**

This could also be called "Social." Reminders to get in touch with certain people, meetups to attend, or any social events and ideas I need to follow up on.

**Emotions**

I personally think that emotional control and emotional mastery is an important part of life. This area is for storing ideas and actionable items related to that—ideas for change, work, and things to improve, if you will.

**Intellect**
:Actions related to learning and knowledge.

**Does not**
: hold a reading list—that goes in lists, below.

**Discipline**
:Actions related to improving my self-discipline.

**Note**
: _For more, see the [Productivity Blueprint][4]_.

**Wealth**
:Actions and items related to finances, banking, investments, and money in general.

**Play**
:Actions and items related to fun things that I want to do—things I want to see, vacations, travel plans etc.

### **Lists**

**Shopping**
:Contains items that I need/want to buy. Some of them will have a context of _@Future_, indicating that I'm aware I'll need it at some point, just not right now.

I also like to segment my shopping list using action groups. This is because there are certain things that I can only purchase when I visit the US, and there are ongoing things that I purchase weekly with my groceries.

**Single Actions**

These are any one-off actions that don't fall under any hotspots. Generic "pay the bills" sorts of activities. The closest equivalent is the activities list within _Agile Results_.

**Reading**

This holds all my current and upcoming reading, grouped into action groups by genre:

* Fiction.
* Non-fiction.
* Business.
* Biography.

It includes both books and courses like the [_Productivity Blueprint_][4]. Any books currently being read have a context of _@Read,_ and future titles have a context of _@Future_.

**Take Notes**

When I'm done reading a book, I'll make an assessment of if I need to create a mind map or take notes on it.

If I do, it goes into this list with an _@Take_ Notes context.

As mentioned in the post on [content consumption][5], you can create a perspective to handle all your reading and note-taking needs.

### Reviews

**Inner Game Review**

I am a big believer in work and self-improvement. Some people say that you can only change behaviors, beliefs, and mindsets through lots of conscious, ongoing, repetition. I think that there are more effective patterns and techniques that you can utilize, to change faster.

I call all this work "inner game," or changing the structure of perception and mindset.

With each change, I create an action group in this list and a set of sub-actions, repeating at intervals of:

* 3 days.
* 3 weeks.
* 3 months.
* 1 year.
* 2 years.
* 3 years.
* 4 years.
* 5 years.

This is the same interval period as you'll see in my book/media reviews list below, and the reason for setting these is so that I am reminded of distinctions that I have made in the past.

For example, here's an entry from about 3 years ago:

"Combining doing the right thing with non-resistance produces consistent success across every area of life."

Now when that idea pops up as due on a certain day, I am reminded that x years ago I made that distinction, and can ask myself if it still holds true, if I am living in accordance with it, if I have internalized in successfully, or otherwise.

**Book and Media Reviews**

This review list supplements the reading and take notes lists mentioned above. It stores actions that remind me to review the mind maps/notes for books/courses that I've read and taken notes for. The intervals are the same:

* 3 days.
* 3 weeks.
* 3 months.
* 1 year.
* 2 years.
* 3 years.
* 4 years.
* 5 years.

### Future Lists

A few years ago, a good friend of mine told me about a concept called his "post-economic" list. He basically separated his life into two segments—before making enough money to never have to work again, and after. He called this after phase "post-economic," which is a term that I've since adopted.

The reason that he made this distinction is that certain things, experiences, possessions, plans and projects should only be pursued when you have the material means to do so, and where you don't need to work day-in, day-out to cover your expenses.

**Note**: _These lists called could also similarly be called "Future/Someday" lists, but I like "Post-Economic" more as it provides a clear indication of when these things can and should happen._

**Post-Economic Learning**

Things I would like to learn when post-economic. Could be skills, languages, or just bodies of knowledge I like to geek out about.

**Post-Economic Projects**

Things I would like to build and accomplish when post-economic. Projects imply a longer period of involvement, personal effort, etc., which distinguishes them from just plans.

**Post-Economic Plans**

Things I would like to simply do when post-economic. Places to travel, things to see, experiences to marvel in.

**Learn Japanese**

This is not post-economic but I had started picking up beginner Japanese a little while ago, but had to put the project aside as other priorities became more important.

### Life Management

I call my rituals folder "Life Management." The content of these lists is fairly similar to what has been written in the [rituals section][6].

One notable difference is that I use fortnightly actions and quarterly actions as my capping cycles for rituals—this is because:

1. We work in 2-week agile sprints at Asian Efficiency and I've similarly structured my life that way.
2. I set goals at 90 day and then 3-5 year intervals.

Without going over each list in detail, they are:

* Daily actions.
* Weekly actions.
* Fortnightly actions.
* Monthly actions.
* Quarterly actions.
* Annual actions.
* * *

## 3\. Contexts

![aaronlynn contexts][7]

My contexts are a bit of a mix-up.

They combine _Agile Results_-style hats with the role- and mindset-based contexts that we've discussed in _OmniFocus Premium Posts_, along with more conventional contexts from _GTD_, as well as some custom ones that I've created.

Here's what they all mean:

### _**@Think: ****Create**_

This context is assigned to any actions where I am creating a new piece of material, or really thinking hard to pull together new ideas.  
Examples would be this very post that I am writing, or creating a mind map based on a book I've just read.

### _**@Think: Research**_

This context is for any research (usually online-based) that I need to do. It could be booking flights, finding accommodations, researching a topic I'm interested in, or finding the answer to a question that's been bugging me all day.

### _**@Think: Organize**_

This context is for organizing things. Moving files, folders and documents. Re-sorting my document cabinet. Anything that involves organization (which I find has a strange calming effect on me!).

### _**@Think: Systems**_

This context is for any systems development work I need to do in my life. It could be finding a new/better way to automate certain actions on my Mac. It could be rewriting my core values and code of conduct. Anything that tweaks a major system in my life is given this context.

### _**@Straight Action**_

Everyone needs a general "just do it" context and this is mine. It also serves as a catch-all for actions that don't neatly fit in other contexts.

### _**@Read**_

I use this context to indicate the books that I am reading right now, and also to mark any book/media review actions.

### _**@Errands**_

Don't be afraid to assign tasks to context groups. I use the context group parent _@Errands _for tasks where I have to go out and do something—be it shopping, paying a bill (Thailand is a little slow on online payments) or otherwise.

### _**@Errands: Tesco**_

I am fortunate enough to live in a city that has online grocery ordering and delivery. Anything that I can order from that grocery store (Tesco Lotus) gets this context.

### _**@Errands: USA, @Errands: Sydney, @Errands: Hong Kong, @Errands: Singapore**_

These contexts represent the cities/places that I visit the most often, and have things to take care of there.

### _**@Inner Game: Install**_

I mentioned the idea of working on your "inner game" beliefs and mindsets above, and this is the context that things I want to implement are given. I chose the word "install" because I like to think of it as uploading a new idea into your mind, _Matrix_-style.

### _**@Inner Game: Review**_

This is a review context for the inner game review list mentioned above.

### _**@Rituals**_

All my ritual actions are assigned this context.

* * *

## 4\. Perspectives

![aaronlynn perspectives][8]

I utilize a very basic set of perspectives.

Of the standard perspectives, I use project view, flagged perspective, and forecast mode a lot—both to make edits to my hotspot lists and projects, and to see when things are due or upcoming.

I do have a couple of custom perspectives.

One is a shopping perspective that is set up like this:

![aaronlynn shopping][9]

I know this goes against what is outlined in the [shopping post][10], but I created it because I shop in multiple cities and found the segmentation useful.

Another is the reading/take notes perspective, exactly as outlined in the post on [managing content consumption][5]. Also related to that perspective is the media review perspective, which is also the same as in that post.

A couple of interesting perspectives that I have are what I call my "Inner Game Install" and "Inner Game Review" perspectives. If you remember from above, I like to do change-work on myself and think about new ways and perspectives to look at things in a structured manner.

The perspective settings look like this:

![aaronlynn innergameinstall][11]

Inner game install perspective settings.

![aaronlynn innergamereview][12]

Inner Ggame review perspective settings.

Install is a running list of ideas that I want to think more about before applying to my life. Review is a perspective I can view daily to review ideas I've implemented in the past, when they come up for review.

* * *

## 5\. Workflow

My OmniFocus 2 workflow is very simple.

I open up OmniFocus 2, go to project view and look through the hotspot-style lists or projects I have there.

Anything I want to work on now or in the near future I flag.

_**Note**: This is a different way to use flags from as taught in _OmniFocus Premium Posts.

I then use the flagged perspective to see what needs to be done, and as I work on items I pull them from OmniFocus into my _Agile Results_-style journal entries in Evernote.

I used to have an active perspective as outlined in the post on _Agile Results_, but no longer do.

When a task or item is done, I mark it as complete in OmniFocus 2.

And that's pretty much it—super simple, and it suits my needs perfectly.

* * *

## 6\. A Day in the Life

How I use OmniFocus on a daily basis doesn't differ too much from what's been outlined in the workflow section above. I will, however, mention a couple of specific things that I do that you may find useful.

**Inbox**

The first is the OmniFocus inbox.

I capture items A LOT. There are some days where I've input 50+ new items into my OmniFocus inbox.

Why?

Because I use quick capture on mobile. I may be out and about and have a random "good idea" and I'll capture it for processing later. And some days, I have a lot of random ideas ![:\)][13] .

Here's how I quick capture:  
1\. Open up the OmniFocus 2 app.  
2\. Tap on quick entry.  
3\. Type away.  
4\. Save.

I've tried to use Siri and the "Remind me to…" feature, but living all over the place has butchered accent to the point where Siri doesn't know if I'm British, American or Australian.

**Rituals**

The second one is rituals. I am a huge, huge fan of rituals.

On a daily basis, I am always using morning, daytime, and evening rituals on my phone, to check off items as I get going in the morning or wind down for the day.

For weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, and annual rituals, I do these at my desktop.

I've played around with different perspectives for representing these before, but found them too complex for my requirements, and so they all have their own, recurring single-action lists now where I just notice when something is due and work it into my plan for that day.

* * *

## 7\. In Closing

And that is my OmniFocus 2 setup in a nutshell.

It's changed a lot from the early days when it was more similar to the tried-tested-and-true setup presented in _OmniFocus Premium Posts_.

It's definitely not for everyone, but it works well for me and I imagine it would also work well for anyone who is a fan of _Agile Results_ and other journal-based task/organization systems.

_**Remember**:_ _start with a tried-and-tested system, and then adapt, evolve and modify your OmniFocus 2 setup over time—that's how you get it efficient in a way that works **for you.**_
